       <p class="aboutme"> Hi! I'm Trista. I'm a travel enthusiast who has travelled to over 20 countries. <br> I find my greatest joy in travelling as I get to discover and explore wolrds I have never seen before <br> The COVID-19 pandemic may have restricted travel possibilities, <br> but I aspire to reflect on my past journeys and explore more in the future. <br> My travel blog will present my favorite destinations and my personal travel guides <br> along with references from brilliant solo travellers that have given me wisdom on travelling as well.  </p>

                        <td> <h3 class="france"> France </h3>  <p class="france"> France can compete with almost any other country on the planet in terms of natural beauty. 
                            With its glittering coastlines of the French Riviera, patchwork fields of the Loire Valley, snow-capped Alps, and centuries-old harbor towns of Normandy, France's scenery is as diverse as it is beautiful.
                             This, of course, is extremely appealing to outdoor enthusiasts. Rather than having to choose between mountains and beaches, France has both, plus a lot more. This gives you more bang for your buck and enhances the enjoyment of your vacation. 
                            Take your camera because these landscapes will make all of your Facebook friends green with envy. So here are the three places that I visited in frace that you <s> can </s> should visit:  </p>

                <p align="center"> When I visited Austria, I knew that it would be a wonderful destination all year.
                    It makes no difference what season you plan to visit. <br>
                    There is always something it has to offer to visitors. As I came in the winter, I enjoyed thrilling ski trips and charming  <br> Christmas markets,
                     while if you visit in the summer, you can enjoy relaxing summer walks along the dreamy shores of lakes. <br> My favorte place in Austria was <strong> innsbruck </strong>. I fell in love with its colonial architecture, <br> the warmth of its people, the mountains surrounding the location and the mirror-like lake in the middle of the city </p> 
                <br>

                        <td align="right"> <h3 class="france"> Japan </h3> <p class="france"> 
                        Japan is one of the world's oldest civilizations, with a rich and varied history. The stunning, diverse scenery with mountains and breathtaking views, 
                        which is highly valued by the Japanese, offers a wide range of experiences that draw visitors from all over the world. Japan has a diverse climate that changes with the seasons.
                        The weather is cold in the north, temperate in the center, and tropical on the southern islands. 
                        If you plan your activities accordingly, this makes Japan a wonderful year-round destination. 
                        If only i can go back in time to these places, I would revisit the richness of Japan's culture. Visit <mark> atleast </mark> <strong> Nagoya, Osaka and Tokyo </strong> if you wish to visit Japan soon.

        <h2 class="heading2"> Travel Tips </h2>
            <h3 class="description"> Here are my top tips you can use for your next travel! </h3>
                <ol> 
                    <li> Take Out Flexible Travel Insurance <strong> (THAT COVERS COVID!) </strong> - If, like me, you spend a lot of time traveling, it's important to use a provider that covers a wide range of activities as well as being flexible in which countries that covers, and for which months. </li>
                    <li> Book Refundable Hotel Rooms In Advance - My recommendation is <a href="https://www.booking.com/?aid=1511299&no_rooms=1&group_adults=2&label=TravelTips"> booking.com</a>. They have by far the largest range of accommodation all around the world, as well as the<u>best</u>prices. But most of all, the majority of their properties offer free cancellation. Meaning, you can book your ideal accommodation months (or weeks) in advance. And if worst comes to the worst and you have to cancel or delay your trip (ahem...Covid) then you don't miss out on any money.</li>
                    <li> Bookmark Places On Instagram To Visit - Instagram comes in super handy when it comes to travelling. I have come to the BEST places thanks to the power of social media. SO, next time, don't forget to bookmark recommended places on instagram for your next trip! </li>
                    <li> Bring a camera! - This is to take the best photos of your trip and I know that some people may not have a high-quality camera to take their photos with. So, you can use your phone but make sure you learn all the nifty tricks to maximize the quality of your pictures. Not sure how? Check out this  </li>
                    <li> Start Preparing Your Trip At Least 6 Weeks Before You Go - We love last-minute trips, but if you're going somewhere that requires a specific visa, some visa applications can take up to 6 weeks, so keep this in mind when planning your trip. There are many great online services, such as <a href="https://www.natvisa.com/"> Natvisa</a>, that take much of the stress out of visa applications by showing you exactly what you need to do and how far in advance you need to do it.</li>
